          <p>
            Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
            transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
            obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
            of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at
            TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how
            officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
            must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
            allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes
            accountability and provides information for citizens about what
            their Government is doing.
          </p>
       
      <p>
        We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
        engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the
        quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
        and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
        knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in
        American government.
      </p>
      <p>
        TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
        readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
        information of greatest use to the public.

        <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>

        <p>
          In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
          scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to
          the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack
          on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their
          intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments
          to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
          example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
          territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
          constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and
          that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent
          historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America
          (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions
          and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
          press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century,
          attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures
          were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians
          and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
          democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of
          information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
          adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the
          origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and
          Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
          independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
          Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
          The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in
          1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws
          were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
